This script refers to the study called: Models and Modelling of Dynamic Moments of Inertia of Human Body
- here we estimate the moments of inertia of the upper and lower arm by calculating the inertia's of certain cylinders
- the used parameters of the cylinder:
    m: mass of the cylinder (kg)
    r: radius of the cylinder (m)
    h: height of the cylinder (m)
the reference for the formula: Machineryâ€™s Handbook 29th Edition
